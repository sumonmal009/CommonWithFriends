So what are the benefits of using a cached thread pool ? Well, the docs state them as follows:

1.The pool creates new threads if needed but reuses previously constructed threads if they are available.

2.Cached thread pool helps improve the performance of applications that make many short-lived asynchronous tasks.

3.Only if no threads are available for reuse will a new thread be created and added to the pool.

4.Threads that have not been used for more than sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Hence a pool which has not been used long enough will not consume any resources.
