ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor provides other methods to schedule periodic tasks. 
It is the scheduleWithFixedRate() method. It has the same parameters as the scheduledAtFixedRate() method, 
but there is a difference worth noticing. In the scheduledAtFixedRate() method, the third parameter determines 
the period of time between the starting of two executions. In the scheduledWithFixedRate() method, parameter 
determines the period of time between the end of an execution of the task and the beginning of the next execution.
